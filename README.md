## The Aim of the Project
"Code: Math" is a new project that aims to link mathematical processes with programming in Python and R. However, the ultimate purpose of this project, is to encourage chlidren whο are not familiar with programming to explore both mathematical concepts and corresponding programming scripts in a simple way.
These mathematical concepts come from Mathematics they learn mainly at school and in university. We believe that the beauty of Mathematics and the clearness of the Programming in combination with the famous programming languages Python and R, could give them the opportunity to develop their knowledge and critical faculties 
as well as to see "boring" topics in a more entartaining and useful way. We will be very pleased, if at least one student through this effort to love more the magical world of Μathematics and Computing. Finally, this project is also targeted at the general public from students to scientists.
## Description of the Project
The concept of the project is very simple:
1. A small theoretical backgroung is developed for each mathematical topic
2. A script using Python and R is presented for the coressponding mathematical topic.
## Requirements for Running the Code
If you want to try the codes, you need only to install Python (or R) and a code studio, such as Visual Code Studio, Rstudio, Jupyter Notebook or generally a 'Code Browser" to your computer.

<!--Future Work
As a feature work it could be an interactive online website in a "game" style..-->
